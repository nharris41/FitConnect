FitConnect is a two-sided marketplace that provides a platform for user’s to schedule appointments with fitness trainers. Users will be able to use FitConnect to find a trainer that suits their fitness needs. This semester, the FitConnect team focused on building the Trainee’s side of the application for the Minimum Viable Product (MVP). Our group’s “clients” are Jonathon Shelley and Cedric Stallworth.
